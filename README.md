<h1><strong>Click the link (https://figma-to-html-app.netlify.app/) to view the webpage live</strong></h1> <br>
<h1><strong>Getting Started</strong></h1> <br>
<strong><h3>To view the webpage locally on your machine, follow these steps:</h3></strong><br>
1. Download all the resources from the main branch and place them in the htdocs folder of your XAMPP installation.<br>
2. If you don't have XAMPP installed, you can download and install it from the official website.<br>
3. Start the XAMPP server.<br>
4. Open the index.html file in any modern web browser.<br><br>

<h3><strong>Note:</strong></h3> While the webpage can be viewed in the browser without starting the XAMPP server, it's recommended to have the server running to ensure all features work as expected.<br><br>

Enjoy exploring the converted Figma design in a live HTML/CSS environment!<br>
