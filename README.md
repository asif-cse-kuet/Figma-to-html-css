# Figma-to-html-css
A webpage designed from Figma to HTML and CSS.

To run the webpage, download all the resources from the main branch to your device's htdocs folder inside xampp. If you don't have XAMPP then install it first.
Run the XAMPP server and open the index.html file with any browser. That's it.
The webpage will be visible in the browser without starting the XAMPP server, but it is recommended to start the XAMPP server before opening the index.html file in the browser.
